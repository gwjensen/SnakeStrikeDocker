LabJackPython requires Python 2.6, 2.7 or 3.x. For Python 3.x, most
functionality has been tested but not all yet. Please report bugs to
support@labjack.com or on GitHub:

    https://github.com/labjack/LabJackPython

To use Modbus first check that your LabJack device meets the minimum required
firmware version listed on this page:

    https://labjack.com/support/software/api/modbus/ud-modbus

To upgrade firmware look at this page:

    https://labjack.com/support/firmware

To use Modbus on a UE9 over Ethernet, install Comm firmware 1.50 or higher.

To install LabJackPython, run the following command in a terminal (remove "sudo"
on Windows):

    $ sudo python setup.py install

If there are multiple versions Python installed, run the install command with
the Python version you want to install to. For example, on Linux if both
Python 2.7 and 3.5 are installed, you can install to Python 3.5 with:

    $ sudo python3.5 setup.py install

From there, interacting with your devices is easy.

For U3:
>>> import u3
>>> d = u3.U3()
>>> d.configU3()
{'BootloaderVersion': '0.27',
 'CIODirection': 0,
 ...,
}
>>> d.close()

For U6:
>>> import u6
>>> d = u6.U6()
>>> d.configU6()
{'BootloaderVersion': '6.15',
 'FirmwareVersion': '0.88',
 ...,
}
>>> d.close()

For UE9:
>>> import ue9
>>> d = ue9.UE9()
>>> d.commConfig()
{'IPAddress' : '192.168.1.209'
 ...,
}
>>> d.close()

For U12:
>>> import u12
>>> d = u12.U12()
>>> d.eAnalogIn(0)
{'overVoltage': 0,
 'idnum': 0,
 'voltage': 1.42578125
}
>>> d.close()
